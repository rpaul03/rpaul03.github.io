<h2>Weaknesses</h2>

</p>

<h1>Logo Inspiration</h1>
<h2>Babby Parrot Patchy</h2>
<p>
  This beautifal baby parrot squawks about how tasty the chocolate is.
    The red, blue, and gold colors show not only the colours of this beautiful baby parrot, but the true American patriotism this comany shares.
    Trump supporters go nuts over this delecious chocolate.
</p>

<h2>Why the logo is effective for the brand</h2>
<p>
The logo is effective for the trump campaign because it shows american colours, but at the time it is still fair trade cocoa.
This chocolate has been approved by Trump because the company isn't getting ripped off by China in the cocoa trades.
</p>

<h2>How the branding/logo makes us stand out</h2>
<p>
Once Trump supporters see the red and blue in the logos they will be in the chocolate store faster than a buttered bullet.
