<p>
  I changed the log in and language to a nicer font and made it white and easier to read.
  I also mede the red less intense and replaced the logo with a new very sexy chicken. The nav bar I made
  more basic black and white and also made the bottom text more centered and nicer to read. I added a new
  sign up icon that stands out and makes it more convinving to click
