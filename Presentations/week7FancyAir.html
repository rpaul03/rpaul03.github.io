      On My website I used 3 different user flow sectons. I made the
      first one really bold on the deluxe package so it is the main icon that people
      will see and bring their attention to. On the last 2 packages, I included the
      all famous "we want you" theme on the book now icons. I chose this because it's probably
      the most persuasive image of all time.
